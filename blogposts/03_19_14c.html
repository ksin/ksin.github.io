    <p>When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?<br><br>

     Accomplishment Accountability Achievement Activism Adventure Affection Ambition Autonomy Challenge Close relationships Commitment Community Compassion Competence Competition Confidence Conformity Control Coolness under fire Cooperation Courage Creativity Credibility Decisiveness Economic security Effectiveness Efficiency Enthusiasm Environmentalism Excellence Excitement Fairness Faith Fame Free time Freedom Friendships Growth Having a family Health Helping other people Helping society Honesty Hospitality Independence Influence Inner harmony Insight Inspiration Integrity Intellectual status Introspection Justice Knowledge Leadership Location Loyalty Meaningful work Mentorship Merit Money Movement Music Nature Openness Order Patriotism Peace Persistance Personal development Physical challenge Pleasure Power and authority Privacy Public service Purity Quality Recognition Reputation Responsibility Romance Security Self-knowledge Self-reliance Self-respect Serenity Sophistication Spirituality Stability Status Tranquility Truth Vibrancy Volunteering Wealth Will-power Wisdom [add any that I missed] <br><br>

     <b>It's really hard to choose. I'm going to say all of the above.</b><br><br>

     One value that is particularly important to me is friendship. Friendship is constantly fluctuating at any given time. It can wane. It can grow. At its worst, people drift apart due to miscommunication or loss of connection over time. At its best, it brings the happiest moments of my life. Of course, family you're stuck with. But I don't think I choose close friends in my life willy nilly. I mean, I don't think you have to select an elite crew of the smartest, prettiest, or coolest people. I don't think I'm the most open and friendly person either. I think successful people surround themselves with people that are encouraging, people that are proud of them, but also people they can be proud of. Similarly, I like to see my friends succeed. I like to see them happy. I like to see them enjoying themselves. Sometimes it's what motivates me. Sometimes offering some of my time or effort to help them makes me happy.<br><br>

     In general, I try to live up to these values: Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">4</span> ----- 5 Agree<br><br>

     The last topic that someone asked for my advice on was how to study for the MCAT. Since I used to be a pre-med student and remember the process of preparing for that test, I tried to give her my honest advice. I told her a lot, but here were my concluding points: <br><br>

     <i>Worry less. Do more. <br><br>

     Meaning, don't spend so much time reading about other people's approaches and comparing scores and techniques or whatever... Just focus on studying and using the material rather than wasting time. Take some time at night being honest with yourself on whether you used your study time effectively. That doesn't mean beating yourself up for procrastinating or not scoring well in your practice tests. It means think about why you might've procrastinated and why you didn't score well. Maybe you need to change your setting. Maybe you need to study the material more or maybe the practice material was harder than you expected and it's not necessarily your fault. <br><br>

      Studying for a standardized test is very different from studying for your typical college classes so it's important for you to develop your own study habits and know what's the best way for you to study on your own. Don't just try to pick up someone else's method and assume it's the best way. Everyone's mind is structured differently when it comes to learning and absorbing things. This might mean you have to take the test a little later to be fully prepared, so be it. Your life isn't over because you took one test a little later than some other folks.</i><br><br>

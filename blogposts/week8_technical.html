    <header><h1>Technical Blog: Active Record<h1> <a href="../index.html">let's go home</a></header>

    <p>Active Record is a pattern - or if you like, a structure - of storing data in relationship databases. It is an approach to access data in a database through the use of classes. It is commonly called Object-Relational Mapping. What this means is that properties and relationships of objects are stored and retrieved from a database using the object-oriented components of a language rather than separate SQL statements. Essentially, it ties objects with database tables such that one can utilize object-oriented methods to design databases. In Rails, the "Model" is the class and the "Table" is the schema. If there was a table comprised of "people", each object would be a "person" row. The benefits of such an application of OO are plenty. The use of associations, inheritance, and modeling follows a very Rails-ish manta: Convention Over Configuration. And that is, Rails favoring the defaults of application be set to conventions rather than require specific, minute, configurations.</p>

    <header><h1>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat<h1> <a href="../index.html">let's go home</a></header>

    <p>I listed a lot of values, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to draw them when I am down, especially if it gets really busy at DBC. The value I pointed out as especially important to me was friendship. It will definitely help mediate stereotype threat. I'm not so concerned that stereotype threat will be a huge factor in DBC. I'm sure most people in our cohort will be supportive. I, too, will try my best to be as involved and rallying as possible since I've heard that the most successful DBC cohorts are the ones that are very active and intimate. If I am feeling down, sometimes I like to be alone, but sometimes I like to talk with some understanding, supportive friends. I think it is always great to surround yourself with encouraging people, so that when you are ready to come out of your alone-time, you can get back into the groove of things more easily.

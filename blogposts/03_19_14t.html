    <p>To understand how Javascript became so popular in web development, you first have to know how websites served content to their viewers in the past. If you think of how content is delivered to viewers on a static page; at the most fundamental level, you have HTML and CSS. Before the advent of CSS pseudo-classes, the only way to update information to someone visiting the site is to generate a new HTML page every time the user performed an action on the site. That means, every time you want to show just a little change on a webpage - not like clicking a link to some completely separate page on the site - you'd have to basically reload the entire page with the new information.<br><br>
    But then here comes Javascript. It can manipulate the DOM - how the site is presented to the visitor on the browser - and add things, remove things, edit things, and manipulate things in all sorts of ways. Specifically, it teams up with the HTML with event finders and handlers. That's what they mean when they say <i>Javascript makes sites interactive</i>. And it brings this interactivity at a much lower cost to the server.<br><br>
    As I mentioned, before Javascript, any kind of interaction basically required a lot communication between the browser and the server - reloading the page, handling arguments, etc. etc. Thanks to the way Javascript works, you don't have to reload the whole page with every action. Javascript allows most of this to be done on the browser. It basically becomes part of the fundamental package - along with HTML and CSS - that the browser reads to know what to show the viewer. That brings us to our second reason why Javascript is so popular. <i>Javascript is ubiquitous</i>. Meaning it is supported by almost every browser! <br><br>
    Lastly, the script itself is quite powerful, being object-oriented, meaning it can be used to create relatively complex methods of organizing data. Thus, not only does it find events, but it can handle them after much more complicated operations. And yet, it is easy to use! It's simple to turn any static page into a dynamic one by uploading Javascript with your HTML and CSS. How neat.

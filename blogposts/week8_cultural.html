    <p>There is a lot to take from the video. I think two big points Shereef discusses, that I saw as huge concerns were: the kitchen vs table mindset and having a non-competing environment. So far, my impression of DBC is that it is trying to do all of what he says. Admittedly, I always had an opinion of DBC as a product, and criticized how it is always somewhat chaotic (at least for the Phase 0 material I've gone through so far). I think this video was helpful to remind myself that there is a lot of figuring stuff out on my part, and a lot of responsibility on my part. To be critical one more time, I think DBC should put this chaotic element of DBC on its site. I'm sure this video, or interviews like this may be found with some research, but overall, it seems to me like DBC never advertises itself as such. Though, I can understand why one wouldn't want to advertise DBC as a grand experiment... <br><br>

    I see myself engaging with the DBC type of culture as much as I can. I think I'm somewhat introverted. While socializing, communicating, and taking initiative with people is not something I can't do, it does strain me more than it energizes me. I think DBC tries its best to provide a safe environment for me to hone my ability to work with different types of people and I will do my best to take advantage of that. Meanwhile, I will try my best to take Shereef's advice and shift my mindset off the typical table mindset and competitive mindset.</p>

    <p>I think a problem that technology faces is resistance to technology. There are a lot of good arguments out there that say we as humans are too attached to / reliant on technology. Of course, this is a first world problem. Technology can also be great for many other things like connecting people and making our lives easier in general. I know of people in South America and Africa who barely use the internet, but even they have Facebook accounts and connect with friends that way.  It's just that you can't ignore the fact that technology is indeed making some people lose their touch with the more tangible things in their lives. It's certainly created some arguably superficial jobs, but I think what's also noteworthy is it creates jobs in general. Just a tech start-up can easily spring up a bunch of jobs. An online retail store hinged on the structure set by its software engineers puts out jobs for designers, sales associates, artists, factories, shippers, etc.<br><br>
    I think there will always be criticism on people that constantly check their feeds or stare at their phones, ignoring the people in front of them for digital bliss. But I do think technology, particularly software engineering or web developing, needs to be embraced more over time. It is still not considered a sort of cardinal profession despite all the potential in the field. I think it's silly that high schools and colleges don't provide or encourage the type of learning environment for programming that DBC promises. So for starters, I'd like to see the education field improve to one that makes the practical use and development of technology a priority. </p>

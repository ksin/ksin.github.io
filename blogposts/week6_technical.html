    <p>The best explanation I have heard, of what object-oriented programming is for, is that: object-oriented programming models the program as objects that are independent of each other. The combined effort of the objects make the program run smoothly and do what it's supposed to do. Each object is like an organ in the body, each organ is a thing of its own, with its own responsibilities, but together, they keep the body alive. Now what that really translates to is that OOP models data as objects that have a "state" and "behavior". That is, each object has internal information of its own, and methods of its own - methods that are both private and invisible to the program interface, and methods that can send/receive messages from other objects. These messages is what seems to define sensible OOP design. Messages between objects form a conversation, and that's what makes the entire program seem like it's a well connected system.<br><br>

    On the other hand, we have functional programming. This is a difficult thing for me to blog about because I don't think I've ever tried programming in a functional language, so my statements are mostly based off research and not practice. I feel I'm not qualified to make a valued judgment on which is better. The analogy that I am familiar with for functional programming is that it models mathematical functions. The data in the program are not objects, it avoids having a "state" because the data does not change - they do not have their own "behavior". Once an input is entered into the programming, it is strictly just that. The program depends only on the arguments that are input in the function. One input comes out with the same output every time. By eliminating side effects (changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs), FP makes it easier to predict the behavior of a program.<br><br>

    In a way, the world we inhabit is similar to the OOP paradigm. Everything is an object. A bike is an object. A person is an object. A road is an object. Riding a bike down a road isn't always going to end up the same. Sometimes the person will ride down the entire road. Sometimes the person will fall off the bike halfway. Behavior is not always predictable, but if you're trying to model your program like a real interaction of objects, then OOP may be exactly what you're looking for. There's value in OOP because it models reality in some ways.<br><br>

    With no experience using a functional language, I do not know what its use is in the grand scheme of things, but it receives just as much praise as OOP for its utility. I would imagine that by making programs predictable, it makes them much easier to understand and develop. It is valuable in forming powerful and complex computations that is relatively transparent. It is probably more applicable in academia than in industrial applications.<br><br>

    With both programs being introduced, I think it is important to remember that "The world you construct in a computer program is at heart an imaginary world, and limiting yourself to making it seem otherwise can be overly constrictive." (David Black) One should not think of what language most corresponds to the real world, but to the imaginary world you're trying to make to make your program successful. Thus, to the question of: which language is better for what? I can't say OOP is better because it models the real world in some ways because the real world is not always what you're supposed to model. If you force yourself to model a real world when the program is supposed to be something completely bonkers, then you're definitely limiting your program and yourself.</p>

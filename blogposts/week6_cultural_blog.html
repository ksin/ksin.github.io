    <header><h1>Stereotype Threat<h1> <a href="../index.html">let's go home</a></header>

    <p>This is not a topic I feel fully comfortable talking about. I feel this is something that should be left to the sociologists. To me, there are too many factors that determine a person's state of mind to put a lot of weight into one explanation for a social phenomenon. Stereotype threat probably exists, but the reasons for it are often vast and not so simple as flipping a switch and saying "I'll change my mindset now." There are large social and cultural conditions that has to shift.<br><br>

    Ideally, everyone sees each other equally as human beings and we all get rewarded based on merit. However, we all know that's not how the world really works. The playing field is not even. Life ain't fair. I think, rather than worrying about the fall to a stereotype threat, one needs to look at their 'stereotype' as an identity. One can't fear their identity or be envious of another person's identity. One must expand their own identity. I believe those most at risk are those that don't have an identity. For example: there's the stereotype that Asians are good at math. Then there are plenty of white male role models in America. American television and cinema: it's mostly white actors. But what do Blacks have? Of course there are awesome people like Denzel and Obama, but they are still the minority. What is the Black identity? The majority of the youths are exposed to rap, basketball, thug life and drug life. When your 'coolest' Black role models are people like T.I. and Lil Wayne who have both been in jail, then yes, it becomes a detrimental identity that turns into a stereotype.<br><br>

    I don't feel comfortable talking about this because I don't think a programming course is the forum to discuss racial connotations. Of course, it is important to be knowledgeable and sensitive to the topic. It's not like I've never faced racism or stereotyping before, but I think I've been fortunate enough that my achievements, goals, and desires, are set by more important factors such as my own determination than anything else. I can easily feel envious of others who are born with something that I don't have. I can feel that I might be limited by my race or sex in some way. Sometimes I do feel that way, and it's frustrating, but mostly, I think it's an excuse. There are always exceptions to the case. Look at how Jeremy Lin go into the NBA despite the challenges he faced as an Asian-American. My answer to the stereotype threat is, become exceptional and show both the world and yourself, you're more than what you seem to be. That's when people will listen to you. Make change from the top. </p>

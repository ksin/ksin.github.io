    <header><h1>Dealing with Conflict<h1> <a href="../index.html">let's go home</a></header>

    <p>One time I got into a huge argument with my brother because he didn't want to do the dishes. We were yelling at each other and swearing. I handled the conflict by asking him why he was so upset and trying to calm him down and make him see my point of view. I think my actions made things better. In the end, we became more honest with each other. I wouldn't change anything about my actions because not only did I resolve the issue, but I learned from. I learned more about me, my brother, and how to deal with conflicts in general.</p>

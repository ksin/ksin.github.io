    <p>Arrays and Hashes are data structures that store multiple data types. They are good for putting multiple objects in one location where they can be conveniently accessed later. The main difference between them is in the order which they store things. Arrays store objects by assigning index numbers to them. This means, each object that is stored in the array is numbered. Typically, you use arrays to store objects numerically so that you can access them later by that order. Hashes, on the other hand, store objects by assigning the value stored to a "key". The key doesn't have to be a number. It can be anything, like a name or a title. You use hashes when you don't care about the order that you access the values later. You would rather access the values with more specific key names.<br><br>

    The loops in Ruby that are common in other languages are the While loop and the For loop. The while loop is to continuously iterating the sequence in the loop until some condition is met. There is usually no set number if times the loop is to run beforehand. The for loop is generally used to iterate through a range. That is, usually when you know how many times you want to run the iteration. Similar to the for loop is the Ruby specific Times loop which basically runs the loop however many times the user declares. That is, it loops 3 times if the user writes 3.times. There are also many looping methods such as each, select, map, and collect, which allows you to specifically iterate over the value of an array or hash.<br><br>

    Javascript is a scripting language to be read by browsers. Ruby is a programming language used to build applications. So in fact, they're both used differently. Javascript's advantage is that its processes can be run by the client. It can directly alter the DOM. Ruby executes on the server side. If Ruby wanted to display things on a browser, it would still have process HTML and CSS. Ruby on Rails is one framework that helps Ruby display its application. Javascript would be better to use for an application with a small amount of dynamic elements. Javascript can actually be used on both the client side and the server side with the support of frameworks, but it might not be as convenient to use as Ruby on Rails.<br><br>

    The logic between the two differs slightly. They are both object oriented. However, their syntaxes are different in several ways. Ruby is generally a friendlier read. For example, a Javascript for loop looks like: <br><br>

    for (i=0; i < n; i++) {<br>
    //code<br>
    }<br><br>

    Where as Ruby looks like:<br><br>
    for i in 0...n<br>
    # code<br><br>

    As you can see, Ruby is a lot less verbose. This simplicity runs throughout the Ruby language.

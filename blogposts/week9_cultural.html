    <p>Consider the feedback you've given and received on Feedbackinator. When was it most useful? When was it less useful? How did feedback either reinforce or encourage you to modify behavior when pairing? Does feedback always have to be negative? How can you give meaningful positive feedback?<br><br>

    So far, the feedback I've given at Feedbackinator has felt a little too restrained for my taste. First of all, I'm not a fan of anonymous feedback. More often than not, I think we can tell who is writing the feedback. I know it is very important to make sure feedback is kind, but I feel that a lot of the feedback I write, and even read of others, feels like it's holding back when it is trying to be critical. For the most part, I don't have critical feedback to give because most of the pairings have been simple and pain-free. I personally find it difficult to balance being sensitive and kind with being clear and straight-forward.<br><br>

    I think having an assigned number of online feedbacks to give makes it seem like homework. Although I understand the importance of it, I think it makes it simple to blow-off. I see a lot of short and meaningless feedback. Admittedly, I sometimes write poor feedback myself. It's not always easy to write good, valuable feedback for every single pairing, especially when you've paired with the same person several times and there wasn't any big issue. You don't want to blow every little thing out of proportion, but at the same time, you want to give a lot of actionable feedback.<br><br>

    Basically, what I think I'm trying to say is that feedback for online pairings isn't especially helpful to me right now because I haven't encountered any issues in my pairings. I think feedback will be really useful when we pair and give feedback in person. I hope to improve my ability to give and accept feedback because it's not only useful for a programmer, but for me as a person in general - to my family, my friends, and my acquaintances. I'd like be good at giving meaningful positive feedback someday. I think I am prone to being upset by failure, and defensive when criticized. I'd like to be able to give and view feedback in a different, more calm and open perspective.</p>

    <header><h1>Pairing and Giving Feedback<h1> <a href="../index.html">let's go home</a></header>

    <p>Pairing with others to solve challenges was overall a good exercise. I believe it's particularly good for a field such as programming where I can easily work on code alone for long periods of time. It's nice to talk to people about code once in awhile. Whether it is to cement an old idea, or to solve a challenge together, I think it's just a healthy habit to talk to someone about what you work on now and then. Afterall, humans are social creatures. Without pairing, I probably would be keeping to myself for most of the things I learn or practice. For now, I don't find it exceptionally fun, rewarding, frustrating, or difficult. My partners have been very easy to collaborate with. Practicing with them helps cement things I read. Occasionally, I learn new things from pairing with someone. I'd like to see a point where the technical level of the pair is about the same, and it is the difficulty of the challenge that tests how well we pair. I'm curious how good pairing is for that kind of situation.<br><br>

    At the time of writing this, I haven't received any feedback yet. From reading and rating others feedback though, I can tell some people had wonderful experiences with others. Generally, the feedback is very kind. Sometimes, I feel people may be a little afraid of being critical. I also don't see too much actionable feedback, just a lot of good feelings and compliments. This is something I can understand because often when I am writing feedback for my pair, I feel like I only have good things to say about our session, and I can't think of anything to tell my partner to do that would really improve our session. Overall, I think pairing and feedback is OK. I'll have to wait to see as we go along how more actionable feedback looks like. Perhaps things will change as the challenges get harder.</p>

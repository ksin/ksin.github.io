Basics:

Make a very simple blog-like webpage. 
Use colors sparingly. More as tags and accents.
Column layout should be fluid and responsive.
Make sure the site looks OK on mobile.
Have three sections: 
1. Look - pictures, images, posts
2. Listen - music and sounds
3. Connect - links and contact that doubles as a footer

Things to do down the line:

Be more selective with typography. Let it guide the viewer through the content.
Organize content to use more negative space so that it stands out.
* Make site like an actual blog where I can make and edit posts online and it'll fit
the column structure I set up, without me having to push an updated html file every time
I want to update. A minimalistic content management system.

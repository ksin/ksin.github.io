Since Wednesday was feature freeze day, we hustled hard on Tuesday night to eek out a feature we really wanted to have for our site: Twitter login. We had many bugs to fix, and we also wanted to Backbone-ify our Javascript. We put everything on a whiteboard and blew through it.

By the end of Wednesday, we had most of our features done and polished. We had a couple of hours to spike on Backbone. We realized that, as much as we wanted to get Backbone in, we just didn't have the time. Instead, we focused on refactoring existing code. We left at 11pm last night after optimizing our styling for the presentation on Friday -- which was actually the earliest we left in awhile.

Of course, there will always be things we want to improve on and add. I remember an instructor once told us we will always have this feeling as a developer. I think now, we've slightly gotten more used to it.

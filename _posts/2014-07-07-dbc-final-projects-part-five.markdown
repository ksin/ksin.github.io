We went from 0 style to lotsa style yesterday. We plowed through many websites to grab ideas. We're still far from having a demo-able site. It's still a little buggy. It seems most of the team finds styling a huge chore. In our retro, we contemplating whether it would have been better to start by styling. However, that was tough to wrap our heads around because we all felt that having ugly, functioning features is better than pretty, non-functionin features.

Currently at 96 passing tests. More styling and refining our code today.

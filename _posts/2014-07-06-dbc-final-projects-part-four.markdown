We got a lot done yesterday. Dave, Judy, and I each implemented a different portion of the site with AJAX. Our code base is getting more and more Javascripty. The merge conflicts thus far have been few to none. The Travis CI build is doing well. We have [86 passing tests][travis-ci-build]. 

Raghav spiked on some CSS and SASS techniques as well as some interactive elements of the site we'll want to implement once we start styling. However, we had a slip in communication there. At the end of the day, Raghav expressed that he felt a little removed from the code since he hadn't touched it all day. His concern was well received, and for the rest of the night, he paired with Dave to finish implementing a feature. This made me happy that our team is open to catching each other up, especially after pushing many many lines of backend code apart from the rest of the team. 

Today will be heavy styling day. We will quickly patch up some things that we found buggy and then dive right into the design. We have some research to do for good website designs. We have to decide on and draw some logos. We have to make some decisions as a group on what our vision of the site will be. We still have to come up with a name for the app!

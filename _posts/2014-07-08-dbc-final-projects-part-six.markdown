Spent most of yesterday doing more styling, bug fixing, and UI stuff. We're really getting there now. Rebecca gave us a really good code review last night. We have some decisions to make now, in what to prioritize for the final days. For example: perhaps we can push one more feature with another API in the next day, or can we focus on refactoring our code and possibly use a neat framework like Backbone to organize our JS, or we can add a few more CRUD functionalities to our app that aren't super essential, but would be great additions, orrrrrr we can take the time to add error handling for every action. 

We have a consulting session in 8 minutes. It should be super helpful.
